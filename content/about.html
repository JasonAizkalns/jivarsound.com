        Admittedly, “j.ivar” is a terse and grammatically incorrect
        {{< link eponym "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eponym" >}} for
        the artist’s given name – Jason Ivar Aizkalns. The latent mountain
        imagery and branding is a nod to his {{< link Latvian
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia" >}} heritage. {{< link "Aizkalns loosely translates to \"beyond the hill\"" "http://www.celmina.com/genealogy/2010/09/surname-saturday-aiz/" >}} or,
        using of some creative liberties, “beyond the mountain”. While
        semantically and visually these ideas are paternal, we recognize that
        any man is equal parts mother and father. Arguably, j.ivar’s musical
        drive is more maternal in nature and draws upon a rich family
        history in this fantastic art.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
        After all, it was j.ivar’s maternal grandfather, Vincent Costello, who
        created the family business test in 1930 in Cleveland, Ohio. Vince
        opened a musical instrument repair shop and established Costello’s
        Music. Repairing instruments for the big bands that would travel through
        the city, Costello’s Music serviced the likes of
        {{< link "Sammy Kaye" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Kaye" >}},
        {{< link "Count Basie" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Basie" >}},
        {{< link "Stan Kenton" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Kenton" >}}, and the “King of Swing”
        {{< link "Benny Goodman" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Goodman" >}},
        to name a few. Vince was also a drummer and had his own swing band.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
        Eventually, Vince returned to his homestead in upstate New York where he
        opened a full line music store. The expanded product portfolio included
        not only musical instruments, but microphones, PA equipment, stage
        lighting, home organs, and even televisions! Getting his son Jim
        involved in the family business, Costello’s Music would grow to include
        installations of audio, video, and lighting equipment. In 2005, Jim
        relocated the business to Florida where
        {{< link "Trinity Audio, Video, & Lighting" "https://www.trinityavl.com/" >}} was born. Trinity-AVL
        continues to service the state and surrounding areas.

      <h2 class="lh-title mb1 mt1 f3-l f4">Early Life</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
        Born in the 80’s, j.ivar was raised by his mother, Mary Jane, and his
        late father, Ivar. Along with his older sister, Laura, the family would
        make a series of small moves along the {{< link "I-270 corridor"
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_270_(Maryland)" >}} in {{<
        link "Montgomery County, Maryland"
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Maryland" >}}. The
        constant, however, was always music.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
        Given his family’s compelling lineage, it is perhaps unsurprising that
        j.ivar took to music at an early age. By age three (3), he was playing keyboard utilizing the
        {{< link "Suzuki Method" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method" >}}.
        Throughout his childhood, he would primarily study piano and music under the instruction of
        {{< link "Katherine Williams" "https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-williams-6b4a3746/" >}}. Circa 1996, his fondness of digital synthesis would come by way of a
        {{< link "Roland XP-10" "https://www.roland.com/us/products/xp-10/" >}} workstation synthesizer. This synth would also
        give j.ivar his first taste of the stage life via a
        {{< link "Kingsview Middle School" "http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/kingsviewms/" >}} talent show (sunglasses included). Around this same time, he
        started to play trumpet in the orchestra which he would carry throughout
        high school. He would eventually join the high school choir and formally
        study music theory, both under the direction of
        {{< link "Jolene Brubaker Baxter" "https://www.facebook.com/jolene.baxter.71" >}}.
        Simultaneously, he began exploring recording, mixing, production, and
        songwriting. Most notably, he composed the commencement song, "Standing
        By You", which he performed live alongside the
        {{< link "Quince Orchard High School" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quince_Orchard_High_School" >}}
        choir and fellow musicians on June 9, 2004.

      <h2 class="lh-title mb1 mt1 f3-l f4">Later Life</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
        Late senior year of high school, passport in hand, j.ivar was on the
        brink of pursuing a technical degree from the
        {{< link "SAE Institute Australia" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_Institute" >}}.
        Ultimately persuaded by family and friends that a stateside Bachelor’s
        degree would be of less risk and greater utility, he attended the
        {{< link "State University of New York (SUNY) Fredonia" "http://home.fredonia.edu/" >}} beginning in 2005 pursuit of a degree in
        {{< link "Sound Recording Technology" "http://home.fredonia.edu/music/srt" >}}.
        There he was privileged to receive additional piano
        instruction from the acclaimed
        {{< link "Father Sean Duggan" "http://home.fredonia.edu/music/faculty-bio-duggan" >}}.
        He would also befriend
        {{< link "David Schoenwetter" "https://soundbetter.com/profiles/32346-david-schoenwetter" >}} and
        {{< link "Adam Korbesmeyer" "https://www.instagram.com/ak47engineering/" >}}.
        Nonetheless, j.ivar would leave SUNY Fredonia after only a year. Motivated in part by the
        allure and closer proximity to a lovely young lady (who would eventually
        become his wife), j.ivar found himself completing his undergraduate
        studies at
        {{< link "Shippensburg University" "https://www.ship.edu/" >}}
        and graduated with degrees in
        computer science, mathematics, and music. Between summer jobs, he
        recorded and mixed amateur bands and musicians out of his father’s
        garage in {{< link "Germantown, Maryland" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germantown,_Maryland" >}}
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
        Like his grandfather, j.ivar would find his way to Cleveland, albeit to begin
        professional life as an
        {{< link actuary "https://www.beanactuary.org/what/" >}} for
        {{< link Progressive "https://www.progressive.com/" >}}.
        Life carried on and j.ivar relocated to
        {{< link "Berks County, Pennsylvania" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berks_County,_Pennsylvania" >}} where he
        would marry that lovely young lady. There he would go on to earn his
        {{< link MBA "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Business_Administration" >}} from
        {{< link "Alvernia University" "http://www.alvernia.edu/" >}} and, through a
        {{< link "series of career opportunities" "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonaizkalns/" >}},
        he developed a second passion for analytics
        and {{< link "data science" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science" >}}.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
        Today, j.ivar resides in
        {{< link "Sinking Spring, PA" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_Spring,_Pennsylvania" >}}
        with his wife (Leslie), daughter (Hadley), and a bichon-pomeranian mix named Lilly.
