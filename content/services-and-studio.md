    <h2 class="lh-title mv3 f3-l f4">Mastering: Sound Great Everywhere</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      A great sounding <em>finished</em> track is the most valuable asset in your musical journey. Mastering is the final step of that journey and my goal is your song sounding its best!
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      We will use advanced EQ, compression, limiting, and other techniques to give your track the tonal balance, loundess, and polish that it needs to compete with commercial hits. We will optimize your track so it sounds great <em>everywhere</em> your fans are listening.
    </p>
    <div class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      We offer two types of mastering services:

        <li>Stereo Mastering: $39</li>
        <li>Stem Mastering (up to 6 stems): $69</li>
        <div class="avenir f7 tj i mt2 mh3">

      If you are looking for a dramatic sonic enhancement, stem mastering is the better choice. With stem mastering, you provide groups of audio tracks from your project. This gives us greater control over each component and allows us to fine tune the core elements of your mix to perfection.
