    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      Free beats may only be used in non-commercial and non-profitable projects. By offering
      free beats, I am giving you the opportunity to "try-before-you-buy". You may use these
      free beats to write, record, and experiment with your music. You are allowed to post the
      final result on your social channels or sites such as YouTube or SoundCloud to solicit feedback and to determine if your song is worth investing in a license. However, without a license, j.ivar sound LLC reserves the right to "pull" or "take down" any published songs or demos at any time. All free versions are "tagged" with a voice tag (a.k.a. beat tag) for security purposes. Should you purchase a license, you will receive an untagged version(s) of the beat.
