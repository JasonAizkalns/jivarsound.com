A few weeks back, I entered a [MetaPop](https://metapop.com/) competition --
specifically, the producer competition, [Produce This #7](https://metapop.com/pages/promos/native-sessions-bars).
This was a fun way to get back into music, keep a timeline, and do something creative.

The rules were simple:

- Download a sample pack.
- Create a 16-bar track. (although I noticed not to many people adhered to this rule...)
- Use at least **two** of the provided samples.
- Genre restricted to hip-hop, R&B, or grime.

Naturally, I chose hip-hop. As of 2018-06-04, you can still download all of the samples [here](https://metapop.com/pages/promos/native-sessions-bars?p=1). In this post,
I'll only be covering the samples that I used in the track. Here's the final result:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/446891328&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

Let's unpack how I got there....

Yes, I admit, I have used the the driving, thumping, [motif](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/motif) in
a previous song -- surprise, surprise called *Anthem* -- hence the name, *Anthem Redux*. Nevertheless,
the provided samples provided some new life and inspiration. In addition, only having
16-bars forced me to find a way to convey all the energy in a limited amount of space & time.
(Perhaps this is what [creative limitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_limitation) is all about?)

## Primary Motif
The primary sample behind all of this is a snippet from "Ensemble OldWeaver". The original,
sounds like this:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/audio/making-of-anthem-redux/ensemble-oldweaver-tuned.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>

<!-- {{< audio "making-of-anthem-redux/ensemble-oldweaver-orig.wav" >}} -->

Chopped up, re-tuned, and at a different tempo, courtesy of [serato sample](https://serato.com/sample) yields:

{{< audio "making-of-anthem-redux/ensemble-oldweaver-tuned.mp3" >}}

Combined with some stacked piano, we get:

{{< audio "making-of-anthem-redux/ensemble-plus-piano.mp3" >}}

## Kicks
Next, I took one of the provided kicks, "Kick Coliseum":

{{< audio "making-of-anthem-redux/kick-coliseum.wav" >}}

Again, re-tune + stack with other samples to get:

{{< audio "making-of-anthem-redux/kicks.mp3" >}}

## Bass
What's a hip-hop without a little 808 bassline? Which at bar 12 gets embellished
with a gritty-wide-mid-bass for stereo spread and better small speaker translation.

{{< audio "making-of-anthem-redux/bass.mp3" >}}

## Snares
I used a provided snare "Snare Brutus" and provided snap "Snap GeorgiaSnapper" and
reversed the snare + tuning + timing + spread to yield...

{{< audio "making-of-anthem-redux/snares.mp3" >}}

...which I augmented with some other samples from [F9 Audio](https://www.f9-audio.com/).

## Guitars
The guitar lead is the "Bluesy Lead" patch from [Omnisphere](https://www.spectrasonics.net/products/omnisphere/) -- with only small sonic enhancements + color. [Spectraonics](https://www.spectrasonics.net/) makes some really nice toys!

{{< audio "making-of-anthem-redux/guitars.mp3" >}}

You can also hear pulsating 16th-note distorted+muted guitars holding down the rhythm.
I fell in love with this technique which you hear a lot in early-to-mid 2000s hip-hop records.
I want to say it can be largely attributed to producer [Mike Elizondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Elizondo).
You can hear this in a lot of 50 Cent and Eminem tracks that he did, but the one that
I always seem to recall is "In da Club" from 50 Cent's *Get Rich or Die Tryin'* (2003) album.

## Strings!
My favorite element of this track has to be the orchestral strings! These are from
the [Cinematic Studio Series](http://www.cinematicstudioseries.com/). In retrospect,
I feel they were mixed too quietly and too far back in the mix -- should I get
around to arranging a more complete version of this song, you can be sure that
I'll find a way to make these stand out a bit more.
