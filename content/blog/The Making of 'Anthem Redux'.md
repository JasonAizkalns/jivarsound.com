title: "The Making of 'Anthem Redux'"

A few weeks back, I entered a [MetaPop](https://metapop.com/) competition --
specifically, the producer competition, [Produce This #7](https://metapop.com/pages/promos/native-sessions-bars).
This was a fun way to get back into music, keep a timeline, and do something creative.
The rules were simple:

- Download a sample pack.
- Create a 16-bar track. (although I noticed not to many people adhered to this rule...)
- Use at least **two** of the provided samples.
- Genre restricted to hip-hop, R&B, or grime.

Naturally, I chose hip-hop. As of 2018-06-04, you can still download all of the samples [here](https://metapop.com/pages/promos/native-sessions-bars?p=1). In this post,
I'll only be covering the samples that I used in the track. Here's the final result:

Let's unpack how I got there....

Yes, I admit, I have used the the driving, thumping, [motif](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/motif) in
a previous song -- surprise, surprise called *Anthem* -- hence the name, *Anthem Redux*. Nevertheless,
the provided samples provided some new life and inspiration. In addition, only having
16-bars forced me to find a way to convey all the energy in a limited amount of space & time.
(Perhaps this is what [creative limitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_limitation) is all about?)

The primary sample behind all of this is a snippet from "Ensemble OldWeaver". The original,
sounds like this:

## TODO Enesemble OldWeaver original

Chopped up, re-tuned, and at a different tempo, courtesy of [serato sample](https://serato.com/sample) yields:

## TODO Ensemble Oldweaver Tuned.

Combined with some stacked piano, we get:

## TODO Stacked Piano plus oldweaver

I then took one of the provided kicks, "Kick Coliseum":

## Kick original

Again, re-tune + stack with other samples to get:

## Kick sampled
