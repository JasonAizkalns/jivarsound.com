This song was supposed to be *very* different.

It started when [Steve Peiffer](https://www.facebook.com/steve.peiffer.1) approached me to
come up with a summer banger -- something that he could release down at the shore.
We got together one night and...failed...we failed hard. What Steve wanted was...

...but every chord progression and melody I kept writing was more...

We eventually called the session a bust and I left with some ideas and lyrics
from Steve:

Refusing to give up and relying on some late night [hypnagogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia)
creativity, I was finally getting somewhere and wrote a workable hook:

I grabbed my iPhone, placed it on the table, and quickly recorded the following:

{{< audio "making-of-infinite-summer/Infinite Summer (Original Idea).mp3" >}}

While certainly not the club hit we were shooting for, this felt like it had potential.
The original song title, "Beaches and Bros" no longer felt appropriate and eventually
this would be renamed to "Infinite Summer".

The next day, the song progressed into a more workable demo:

{{< audio "making-of-infinite-summer/Infinite Summer (Scratch Demo).mp3" >}}

In time, I would tweak a few lyrical lines and wrote a second a verse to be sung
by a female. Stay tuned...more to come on this one!
