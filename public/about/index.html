      Admittedly, “j.ivar” is a terse and grammatically incorrect
      <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eponym" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">eponym</a> for
      the artist’s given name – Jason Ivar Aizkalns. The latent mountain
      imagery and branding is a nod to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Latvian</a> heritage. <a href="http://www.celmina.com/genealogy/2010/09/surname-saturday-aiz/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Aizkalns loosely translates to &#34;beyond the hill&#34;</a> or,
      using of some creative liberties, “beyond the mountain”. While
      semantically and visually these ideas are paternal, we recognize that
      any man is equal parts mother and father. Arguably, j.ivar’s musical
      drive is more maternal in nature and draws upon a rich family
      history in this fantastic art.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      After all, it was j.ivar’s maternal grandfather, Vincent Costello, who
      created the family business test in 1930 in Cleveland, Ohio. Vince
      opened a musical instrument repair shop and established Costello’s
      Music. Repairing instruments for the big bands that would travel through
      the city, Costello’s Music serviced the likes of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Kaye" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Sammy Kaye</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Basie" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Count Basie</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Kenton" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Stan Kenton</a>, and the “King of Swing”
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Goodman" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Benny Goodman</a>,
      to name a few. Vince was also a drummer and had his own swing band.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      Eventually, Vince returned to his homestead in upstate New York where he
      opened a full line music store. The expanded product portfolio included
      not only musical instruments, but microphones, PA equipment, stage
      lighting, home organs, and even televisions! Getting his son Jim
      involved in the family business, Costello’s Music would grow to include
      installations of audio, video, and lighting equipment. In 2005, Jim
      relocated the business to Florida where
      <a href="https://www.trinityavl.com/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Trinity Audio, Video, &amp; Lighting</a> was born. Trinity-AVL
      continues to service the state and surrounding areas.

    <h2 class="lh-title mb1 mt1 f3-l f4">Early Life</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      Born in the 80’s, j.ivar was raised by his mother, Mary Jane, and his
      late father, Ivar. Along with his older sister, Laura, the family would
      make a series of small moves along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_270_%28Maryland%29" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">I-270 corridor</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Maryland" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Montgomery County, Maryland</a>. The
      constant, however, was always music.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      Given his family’s compelling lineage, it is perhaps unsurprising that
      j.ivar took to music at an early age. By age three (3), he was playing keyboard utilizing the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Suzuki Method</a>.
      Throughout his childhood, he would primarily study piano and music under the instruction of
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-williams-6b4a3746/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Katherine Williams</a>. Circa 1996, his fondness of digital synthesis would come by way of a
      <a href="https://www.roland.com/us/products/xp-10/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Roland XP-10</a> workstation synthesizer. This synth would also
      give j.ivar his first taste of the stage life via a
      <a href="http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/kingsviewms/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Kingsview Middle School</a> talent show (sunglasses included). Around this same time, he
      started to play trumpet in the orchestra which he would carry throughout
      high school. He would eventually join the high school choir and formally
      study music theory, both under the direction of
      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jolene.baxter.71" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Jolene Brubaker Baxter</a>.
      Simultaneously, he began exploring recording, mixing, production, and
      songwriting. Most notably, he composed the commencement song, "Standing
      By You", which he performed live alongside the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quince_Orchard_High_School" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Quince Orchard High School</a>
      choir and fellow musicians on June 9, 2004.

    <h2 class="lh-title mb1 mt1 f3-l f4">Later Life</h2>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      Late senior year of high school, passport in hand, j.ivar was on the
      brink of pursuing a technical degree from the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_Institute" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">SAE Institute Australia</a>.
      Ultimately persuaded by family and friends that a stateside Bachelor’s
      degree would be of less risk and greater utility, he attended the
      <a href="http://home.fredonia.edu/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">State University of New York (SUNY) Fredonia</a> beginning in 2005 pursuit of a degree in
      <a href="http://home.fredonia.edu/music/srt" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Sound Recording Technology</a>.
      There he was privileged to receive additional piano
      instruction from the acclaimed
      <a href="http://home.fredonia.edu/music/faculty-bio-duggan" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Father Sean Duggan</a>.
      He would also befriend
      <a href="https://soundbetter.com/profiles/32346-david-schoenwetter" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">David Schoenwetter</a> and
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ak47engineering/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Adam Korbesmeyer</a>.
      Nonetheless, j.ivar would leave SUNY Fredonia after only a year. Motivated in part by the
      allure and closer proximity to a lovely young lady (who would eventually
      become his wife), j.ivar found himself completing his undergraduate
      studies at
      <a href="https://www.ship.edu/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Shippensburg University</a>
      and graduated with degrees in
      computer science, mathematics, and music. Between summer jobs, he
      recorded and mixed amateur bands and musicians out of his father’s
      garage in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germantown,_Maryland" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Germantown, Maryland</a>
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      Like his grandfather, j.ivar would find his way to Cleveland, albeit to begin
      professional life as an
      <a href="https://www.beanactuary.org/what/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">actuary</a> for
      <a href="https://www.progressive.com/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Progressive</a>.
      Life carried on and j.ivar relocated to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berks_County,_Pennsylvania" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Berks County, Pennsylvania</a> where he
      would marry that lovely young lady. There he would go on to earn his
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Business_Administration" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">MBA</a> from
      <a href="http://www.alvernia.edu/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Alvernia University</a> and, through a
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonaizkalns/" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">series of career opportunities</a>,
      he developed a second passion for analytics
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">data science</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy f5-ns f6 athelas">
      Today, j.ivar resides in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_Spring,_Pennsylvania" class="link light-blue hover-bg-lightest-blue hover-near-black ba ph1 dib">Sinking Spring, PA</a>
      with his wife (Leslie), daughter (Hadley), son (Foster), and a border-collie-poodle mix named Gibson.
